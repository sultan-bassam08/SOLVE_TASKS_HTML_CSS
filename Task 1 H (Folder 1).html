<H1>LINEAR EQUATIONS</H1>
<P>
An equation that has maximum degree one is known as Linear Equations. The graph of it is a straight line.
For example,<br>
• Y = 8<sub>x</sub> - 2
• ax<sub>1</sub> + bx<sub>2</sub> - ex<sub>3</sub> = 9<br>
are some of the examples of a linear equaion in two and three variables.
Slope of intersectio/\of two linear equations Linear equations<br>
y<sub>1</sub> = mx + a and<br>
y<sub>2</sub> = mx<sub>2</sub> + b<br>
for the points P(x1- Y1) and Q(<sub>2</sub>- Y<sub>2</sub>) is:
</P>
<H4>m = (y<sub>2</sub>-y<sub>1</sub>)/ Q(X<SUB>2</SUB>-x-<sub>1</sub>)</H4>
