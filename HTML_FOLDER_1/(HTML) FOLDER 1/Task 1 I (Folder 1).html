is the science <mark> and study of quality, structure, space,</mark>and change. Mathematicians seek out patterns,
    <P> formulate new conjectures, and establish truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions.</P>

<p><u>There is debate over whether mathematical objects such as numbers and points exist naturally or are human creations. The mathematician <b>Benjamin Peirce </b>called mathematics</u>" the science that draws necessary conclusions," Albert Einstein, on the other hand, stated that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain: and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."</p>

<p>
<mark>Chemistry</mark> is the study of matter and the ways in which different forms of matter combine with each other. <u>You study chemistry because it helps you to understand the world around you</u>. Everything you touch or taste or smell is a <b>chemical,</b><u> and the interactions of these chemicals with each other define our universe. <mark>Chemismy forms the fundamental basis for biology and medicine.</mark></u>From the structure of proteins and nucleic acids, to the design, synthesis and manufacture of drugs, chemistry allows you</p>
